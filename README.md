VLSI Project: Design and Simulation of CMOS, Combinational, and Sequential Circuits

Overview

This repository contains the implementation and simulation of CMOS circuits, combinational logic, and sequential logic circuits using **Xilinx ISE 14.7** and **Cadence EDA tools**.

- Combinational Logic Circuits: Design and simulate circuits such as multiplexers, decoders, and arithmetic blocks (e.g., adders).
- Sequential Logic Circuits: Implement and validate flip-flops, shift registers, and counters.
- EDA Tool Integration: Use Xilinx ISE for FPGA-based design and Cadence for schematic capture, layout design, and simulation.
- Verification and Analysis: Ensure functionality through simulation and evaluate critical parameters like power and timing.
